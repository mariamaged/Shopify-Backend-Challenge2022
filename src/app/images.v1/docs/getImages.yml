      description:
        Get all images that are either (public) or (private and belonging to the user identified from the authorization token).
        This is done by specifying the query parameter called isPublic to be either the value 'true' or 'false'.
        It is optional and the default for it is true to get public images.
        The route returns the same data that the post route returns with the images' linkUrls to be viewed as well as metadata for each image.
